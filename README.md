# CrowdPay

[![CI](https://github.com/Savitura/crowdpay/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Savitura/crowdpay/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Global funding infrastructure built on Stellar.**

---

## Quick start with Docker

The fastest way to run the full stack locally (requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)):

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose up
```

| Service  | URL                        |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173       |
| Backend  | http://localhost:3001       |
| Postgres | localhost:5432             |

The database schema is applied automatically on first start. Backend supports hot-reload via nodemon; frontend supports HMR via Vite.

---

CrowdPay is not a crowdfunding website — it is a payments protocol with a product layer on top. Contributors anywhere in the world can fund campaigns in any currency. Stellar handles the conversion, settlement, and custody automatically.

---

## Why Stellar

Most crowdfunding platforms are limited by payment rails. Bank transfers are slow, cross-border fees are high, and currency conversion is opaque. CrowdPay eliminates all three by settling everything on Stellar.

| Problem | How Stellar solves it |
|---|---|
| Cross-border payments | Path payments auto-convert any asset to the campaign's target currency |
| Escrow / trust | Multi-signature accounts require both creator and platform to approve withdrawals |
| Fiat on/off ramp | Stellar anchors bridge NGN, USD, EUR to on-chain assets |
| Fees | Stellar transactions cost fractions of a cent |
| Speed | Transactions finalize in 3–5 seconds |

---

## How It Works

### Campaign wallets

Every campaign gets its own Stellar account — not a database row, an actual on-chain account. That account is controlled by two signers:

```
Campaign Account
  Signers:
    Creator key  (weight 1)
    Platform key (weight 1)
  Threshold:
    Medium: 2   ← both must sign to move funds
```

This means funds are locked in escrow by default. No code, no smart contract, no trust — just cryptographic multisig enforced by the Stellar network.

### Contribution flow

```
User clicks "Contribute"
  → Backend builds Stellar transaction
      (Payment or Path Payment depending on asset)
  → User signs (custodial: backend signs; non-custodial: user's wallet)
  → Transaction submitted to Stellar testnet / mainnet
  → Horizon streams ledger events


### Wallet Architecture & Security

Each campaign wallet is secured with:

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for private key storage
- **Multisig control** requiring both creator and platform signatures
- **Disabled master keys** after initial setup
- **Full audit trail** of all transactions and payments
- **Recovery procedures** for encrypted wallet secrets

See [WALLET_ARCHITECTURE.md](WALLET_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete technical details.


  → Backend confirms + indexes in PostgreSQL
  → Campaign progress updates in real time
```

### Path payments (the edge)

A contributor in Nigeria with XLM can fund a USD-denominated campaign. Stellar's DEX finds the best conversion path automatically. The campaign receives USDC. The contributor never thinks about exchange rates.

```
XLM (contributor) → [Stellar DEX] → USDC (campaign wallet)
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Blockchain | Stellar (testnet for development, mainnet for production) |
| Backend | Node.js, Express |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | React, Vite |
| Stellar SDK | `@stellar/stellar-sdk` |
| Auth | JWT |

---

## MVP Scope

- Create campaigns with a target amount and asset (USDC or XLM)
- Auto-generate a multisig campaign wallet on Stellar
- Accept contributions in any Stellar asset (path payment handles conversion)
- Display real-time funding progress (Horizon event stream)
- Withdraw funds (requires both creator + platform signature)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- A Stellar testnet account (free via [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org))

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd crowdpay

# Backend
cd backend && npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add your Stellar platform keypair, DB credentials, and optional anchor on-ramp config
```

To enable SEP-24 anchor deposits, configure the backend anchor signing wallet and a supported anchor:

- `ANCHOR_WALLET_HOME_DOMAIN`
- `ANCHOR_WALLET_SIGNING_SECRET`
- `ANCHOR_MONEYGRAM_ENABLED` (default `true`)
- `ANCHOR_MONEYGRAM_ENV` (`sandbox`, `preview`, or `production`)

For a custom anchor, configure:

- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ID`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_NAME`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_HOME_DOMAIN`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_SEP24_ENDPOINT`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_SIGNING_KEY`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ASSET_CODE`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ASSET_ISSUER`
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_NETWORK` (`testnet` or `mainnet`)
- `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_RAILS` (comma-separated)

Creator identity verification is enforced by default before campaign launch. For local testnet development, set `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS=false` in the backend environment; optionally mirror it with `VITE_KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS=false` so the frontend knows before the profile request returns. For Persona-hosted verification, configure `KYC_PROVIDER=persona`, `PERSONA_API_KEY`, `PERSONA_TEMPLATE_ID`, and `APP_BASE_URL`.

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
cd backend

# First-time setup: create DB and apply all migrations
npm run migrate:fresh

# After pulling new migrations from main branch
npm run migrate
```

The migration runner automatically:
- Creates the database schema from `db/schema.sql`
- Applies migration files in `db/migrations` in chronological order
- Tracks applied migrations to prevent duplicates
- Rolls back cleanly on error

### 4. Fund your platform account on testnet

```bash
# Run the account setup script
node contracts/stellar/campaignWallet.js --setup-platform
```

This creates and funds a testnet platform account using Friendbot.

### 5. Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:3001`  
Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

### Testing

```bash
# Backend unit + route tests
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
cd frontend && npm test

# End-to-end tests (Playwright — starts backend + frontend dev servers)
# Requires PostgreSQL with schema + seed applied (see docker-compose on port 5433)
npm install
npx playwright install
npm run test:e2e
```

## Core Stellar Concepts Used

### Multisig escrow
Every campaign wallet is created with `setOptions` to add two signers (creator + platform) and set medium threshold to 2. Funds cannot be withdrawn without both parties signing.

### Trustlines
Before a campaign wallet can receive USDC, it must establish a trustline to the USDC issuer. The backend automates this during campaign creation — users never see it.

### Path payments
Contributions use `pathPaymentStrictReceive` so the campaign always receives the exact asset it expects, regardless of what the contributor sends.

### Horizon streaming
The backend opens a streaming connection to Horizon to watch each campaign wallet for incoming payments. When a payment lands, it is indexed in PostgreSQL and the campaign total updates.

---

## Custody Model

**MVP: Custodial**

The platform holds all private keys in encrypted storage. This gives the best UX — contributors do not need wallets. Users sign in with email. The platform cosigns all transactions.

**Phase 2: Non-custodial**

Integrate Freighter (browser wallet) or WalletConnect. Users hold their own keys. Platform key is still required for campaign withdrawals (enforces milestone gates).

---

## Phase 2 Roadmap

- [ ] Milestone-based fund releases (release tranches, not full balance)
- [ ] Fiat on-ramp via Stellar anchors (NGN, USD)
- [ ] Multi-currency campaigns
- [ ] Freighter wallet integration
- [ ] Public API for third-party campaign embeds

## Network

| Environment | Stellar network | Horizon URL |
|---|---|---|
| Development | Testnet | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` |
| Production | Mainnet | `https://horizon.stellar.org` |

Switch via `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet\|mainnet` in `.env`.
